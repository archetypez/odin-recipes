        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Potato leek soup, or potage parmentier, is a French classic. It’s one of the first dishes I learned to make in culinary school, right after a proper omelet and basic vinaigrette, because it’s an essential base soup in French cuisine. Add watercress to make potage au cresson, serve it chilled to make Vichyssoise, or top it with bacon, fried leeks, fresh herbs, or diced vegetables.</p>
    
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Leeks</li>
                <li>Butter</li>
                <li>Potatoes</li>
                <li>Chicken or vegetable broth</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Melt the butter over medium heat in a large soup pot. Add the leeks and garlic and cook, stirring regularly, until soft and wilted, about 10 minutes. </li>
                <li>Add the potatoes, broth, bay leaves, thyme, salt and pepper to pot and bring to a boil. Cover and turn the heat down to low.</li>
                <li>Fish out the thyme sprig and bay leaves, then purée the soup with a hand-held immersion blender until smooth.</li>
            </ol>
