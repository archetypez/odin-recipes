        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>In the great debate of whether lobster rolls are best when served Connecticut-style with melted butter or the Maine way laced with lemony mayonnaise, I say do a combo of both! Trust me, youâ€™re going to love these.</p>
    
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Lobster</li>
                <li>Butter</li>
                <li>Mayonnaise</li>
                <li>Lemon juice and zest</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Rinse the lobster meat and pick through for any loose shells. Drain throughly so the mayo sauce doesn't get watery. Chop or tear into large chunks and set aside.</li>
                <li>In a large bowl, mix the celery, mayonnaise, chives, lemon juice, lemon zest, kosher salt and ground black pepper. Taste for seasoning.</li>
                <li>Load each bun equally with lobster meat and garnish with more chives if desired. Serve with potato chips.</li>
            </ol>
